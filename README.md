# household_electricity_consumption_forecasting



After performation EDA(exploratory data analysis)we have to seen trends of power usages in household .

The time series has no upward or downward trend. The highest average power consumption seems to be prior to 2007 and thats because we only have december data for 2007. December is winter month and its expected to have power consumption increased.

We analyze that by year , power is steady after 2007 by month , power is lowest in 7th month by day power is lowest on 8th of every month by quarter, its lowest on 3rd quarter.

Also we check which years weeks and weekends consume more energy.

We use dickey fuller test to check
data is is stationary or not.

After we implement LSTM for forecasting and we get a good resut from it.
